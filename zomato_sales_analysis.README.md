<h3> Objective </h3>
    <p> The objective of this project was to perform a sales analysis for a company named Zomato. Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. </p>

<h3> What did I do? </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Familiarized myself with the provided data </li>
        <li> Organized, formatted, and cleaned the data in Microsoft Excell </li>
        <li> Loaded data in Tableau and properly joined the necessary data </li>
        <li> Built 5 Tableau visualizations to include...
            <ul>
                <li> The top ten restaurants by total sales </li>
                <li> The percentage of sales by restaurant </li>
                <li> The average sales revenue per customer </li>
                <li> The total sales over time </li>
                <li> Retention Rates </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Dominoes: Dominoes Pizza has approximately Â¼ of total sales out of the top 10 pulling in a total revenue of $5 million. </li>
    <li> Customer consistency: Customers that are retained spend at consistent rates. </li>
    <li> Sales decline: Zomato has experienced an overall decline in sales from October 2017 to June 2020 via an approximate 40% drop in total revenue. </li>
    <li> Poor customer retention: The customer retention rate dropped 50% from October 2017 to June 2020. </li>
</ul>


<h3> Recommendations </h3>
<p> Further analysis of customer and restaurant analysis should be performed. As well as analysis of external factors such as economic conditions, competition, health and safety concerns (especially the impact of COVID-19), etc. Aside from further analysis, more incentive programs could be implemented to improve customer retention, innovation and performance enhancements for some of the poor performing sites. Lastly, some inter-company mentorship to figure out what the top performers are doing right and how that can be implemented for the bottom performers. </p>
