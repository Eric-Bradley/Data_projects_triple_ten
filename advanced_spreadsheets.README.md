<h1> Advanced Spreadsheets Project </h1>
<h3> Objective and Goals </h3>
<p> The purpose of this projects was to analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhatta borough of New York city to narrow down the types of properties that are good investments. </p>
<h3> What did I do? </h3>
<ol>
  <li> First I cleaned the data so it was suitable for analysis </li>
  <li> Then I added filters to include...
    <ul>
      <li> filtered out all listings that were not listed by a "superhost" </li>
      <li> standardized the format of the neighborhoods column and added a new column called "neighborhood_clean" </li>
      <li> filtered the price to be between $99 and $500 per night to ensure a positive ROI and consistent occupancy </li>
      <li> minimum nights less than 8 to ensure the listings were short term rentals </li>
      <li> number of reviews greater than 48 within the last 12 months as an extra measure to filter out listings that were not profitable </li>
      <li> reviews average greater than 4.8 </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
