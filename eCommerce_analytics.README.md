<h3> Objective </h3>
<p> The objective of this project was to analyze raw transaction logs </p>


<h3> What did I do? </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Built a conversion funnel using a pivot table 
      <ul>
        <li> Used formulas to create two new columns in the pivot table; total conversion rates and conversion rates </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Prepared data for cohort analysis
      <ul>
        <li> Created a new sheet called "purchase_activity" that contained only purchases </li>
        <li> Calculated first purchase dates </li>
        <li> Setup monthly data to build and track cohorts </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Calculated retention rates
      <ul>
        <li> Grouped data into cohorts </li>
        <li> Calculated overall retention rates </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Organized and documented the spreadsheet </li>
  </ol>


<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> Via my analysis I found that the conversion rate based on a predictable sequence user interaction with our website is 9.99%. The conversion rate based on an unpredictible user interaction is 10.34%. </p>and

<p> User rentention suffers a steep drop after two months. </p>
